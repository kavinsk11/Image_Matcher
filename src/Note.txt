As in the picture, We need to create an Ui interface in ReactJs. 
Things to note and to implement:
1. The Instagram and Decathlon logo's should be in a same closed box frame layout as same in the picture.
2. Add the instagram and Decathlon Logo as same in the picture.
3. Add Upload image option.
4. The "Reset" button should clear the Session(Pictures).
5. Find a match should find through vector scaling.
6. Matching Products should have an scroll option to scroll for more related pictures after Clicking "Find a Match"
7. The Ui should be more professional and use some gradient colors in background to look more professional
